An estimated 50 percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have jobs. Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits. In the first half of 1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade. Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City metropolitan area. To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s. We are supposed to be stewards of this land.",

He admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that no one showed ill effects. Bans imposed by international organizations range between two months and life. A report by the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse estimates that half a million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids. The increased usage among girls, which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s. A study published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3 percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports. More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread. Anabolic (which means ``building'') steroids were made illegal in the United States in 1990, except with medical prescription.",

Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection. He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources. The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the administrative bureau based in Switzerland. The formation of a new International conservation body announced today was vital to the wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told at the Ramsar meeting today. Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of disappearing wetland acres. The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years. The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as well as parts of the northern suburbs. Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years. Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system. The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction. He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones. Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's \"kidney\" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land. They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.",

                    "summary": " Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction under the nationwide permit system. Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection. He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources. The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the administrative bureau based in Switzerland. The formation of a new International conservation body announced today was vital to the wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told at the Ramsar meeting today. Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of disappearing wetland acres. The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years. The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as well as parts of the northern suburbs. Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years. Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system. The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction. He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones. Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's \"kidney\" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land. They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers. The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water. The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas, including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would flow underground. Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988. The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe.",

They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers. The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water. The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas, including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would flow underground. Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988. The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe. In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road, leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut timber and no way to remove it. The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project. The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the feasibility of the larger project; the study is expected to be completed by May 2000. New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.",

To Americans, Chretien's determination to impose strict ``rules of secession'' might seem sensible enough, a worthy precaution against the day when Quebec might rise again. After years in Ottawa, preoccupied with national politics, Charest seems to have forgotten that even Quebecers opposed to secession don't carry much love for Canada in their hearts. When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little chance of retaining power. Even those who think secession is a bad idea will support the Parti Quebecois if the party seems to serve the greater good of the province. The move is seen as a key part of Ottawa's strategy of challenging separatists arguments that Quebec has a right to separate regardless of the views of the rest of Canada. The separatists, whose backing comes almost entirely from Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in a much larger number of districts spread across the province. Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because \"people in Quebec don't want any referendum,\" Chretien said. He took over the leadership from Parizeau in the referendum campaign and he was credited with his role in the final campaign which brought separatists to a near victory from the hopeless mood.",

Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his 1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species. Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution. Langmade, who attended ASU and the University of Alaska, takes exception to the idea that creationists cannot embrace the panorama of science if they reject evolution. Celtie Johnson said she spent decades believing that humans evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other species over millions of years. That does not deter Ms. Bennett from teaching her students that humans and all other species developed from common ancestors under the influence of natural selection. Those who take the biblical account of creation literally reject the scientific method, offering instead a doctrine of faith. Perhaps rejection of the scientific method reflects a turning away from unhappy aspects of our contemporary society _ greed, vulgarity and the like. Most of us thought the attempt to stifle the teaching of evolution was a fringe phenomenon. Many school districts across Kansas have gone on the record that despite the action by the state board, they will continue to include the teaching of evolution and related subjects in their curricula. Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern biology. The Alabama label explains that evolution is a theory and that text statements about the origins of life should be considered as such. The launching of a center to promote ``theistic science'' or ``intelligent design'' is proving to be one of the biggest controversies of the Robert Sloan presidency. He said the proposal's intent in mentioning intelligent design was to acknowledge that more than one theory existed on life's origins.",

He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions. Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech. The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic. President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,\" Sergeyev said in Fergana, Uzbekistan. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. The Russian military claimed that nearly a dozen rebels were killed and several taken prisoner during another battle in the southern Itum-Kale region, Interfax reported. Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living. The curfew will be tightened up on the whole territory of the roily republic from 21:00 to 7:00. Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital, although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. He noted that the most recent terrorist bomb attacks in a number of Chechen communities did not produce the results expected by their organizers.",

                    "summary": " Speaking in the southern Russian town of Vladikavkaz, Viktor Kazantsev, commander of Russian forces in North Caucasus region that includes Chechnya, said there was no order to take Grozny. He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions. Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech. The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic. President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,\" Sergeyev said in Fergana, Uzbekistan. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. The Russian military claimed that nearly a dozen rebels were killed and several taken prisoner during another battle in the southern Itum-Kale region, Interfax reported. Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living. The curfew will be tightened up on the whole territory of the roily republic from 21:00 to 7:00. Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital, although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. He noted that the most recent terrorist bomb attacks in a number of Chechen communities did not produce the results expected by their organizers. Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency reported. Manilov said there were fewer than 2,000 bandits remaining in parts of Chechnya's southern mountains not held by Moscow. Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev. Moscow has said it sent troops into Chechnya to crush the militants, who are also blamed for a series of deadly apartment explosions in September.",

Murad joined Egyptian investigators in demanding the release of classified data regarding three high-speed radar images passing near EgyptAir Flight 990 just before it began its dive into the Atlantic.

A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a more active role in combating racial intolerance. The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with information about the slaying to contact police. The prince expressed his \"deepest sympathy\" to Stephen's parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture in London. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him. The new measures would focus on tackling \"institutionalized racism\" in the police service, with a shake up of training and procedures. In the meantime, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is promising a full assault on racism, including moves to broaden anti-discrimination laws to cover now-exempt police and government departments. Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in 1993. Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus stop by a group of white attackers. The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted \"institutional racism\" in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The report into the racist murder of Lawrence which was released earlier in the day labeled London's police force \"institutionally racist\" and condemned officers for \"fundamental errors. Three of the suspects -- Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences collapsed. Because the initial investigation was so flawed, the prosecution of three of the five suspects failed to win convictions and crown prosecutors dropped the cases against the other two. Stephen, 18, was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in southeast London in 1993. Black teeager Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a bus-stop in Eltham, south London by five white youngsters six years ago. Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged again because they were acquitted. Two suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder case and one other man were arrested Monday on suspicion of theft by Kent Police, police said. Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk, the report said. She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately. The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena, a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital. The number of racist crimes being reported in Britain was rising sharply.",

The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud. Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud. Tight laws at home and a rise in abandonment also helped turn China into a popular place for Westerners, especially Americans, looking to adopt. The Canadian government today announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high.

The Federal Trade Commission charged a New York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders. Publicity about ADD and its cousin, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many people with the disorders more aware of their condition. By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD medication in school during the 1995-96 school year. The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six months. Most ADHD research has involved that age group, and the academy also said it recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers. Though he holds master's degrees in neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain or abnormal glucose metabolism. The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View, Calif.'s Alza Corp., which can now enter the $700 million-a-year market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5 percent of children in the United States. A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. Two lawsuits filed this week accuse the makers of the drug Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association of encouraging overdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children to boost sales of the drug. People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible, unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in school, social life and careers. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still. Once considered to afflict only children, the disorders are now said to have been diagnosed in 3 percent to 5 percent of adults, too. They believe it is the largest study of the disorder. Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting. ADHD is characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty in paying attention and keeping still.",

The Federal Trade Commission charged a New York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders. Publicity about ADD and its cousin, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many people with the disorders more aware of their condition. By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD medication in school during the 1995-96 school year. The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six months. Most ADHD research has involved that age group, and the academy also said it recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers. Though he holds master's degrees in neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain or abnormal glucose metabolism. The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View, Calif.'s Alza Corp., which can now enter the $700 million-a-year market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5 percent of children in the United States. A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. Two lawsuits filed this week accuse the makers of the drug Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association of encouraging overdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children to boost sales of the drug. People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible, unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in school, social life and careers. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still. Once considered to afflict only children, the disorders are now said to have been diagnosed in 3 percent to 5 percent of adults, too. They believe it is the largest study of the disorder. Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting. ADHD is characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty in paying attention and keeping still. Long-term damage can range from no effect to a loss of coordination or thinking ability to death. Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years. The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone. What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat behavior rather than disease.",

                    "summary": " Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers. Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year. The sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their books. Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association. Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion. In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed. Booksense's goal is to build the independents' share to 10 or 11. In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores. The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members. The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger. It ships 115 million titles every year. The online division is also preparing to introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected 1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million. The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are under siege. In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent. Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent.",

                    "summary": " Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers. Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year. The sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their books. Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association. Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion. In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed. Booksense's goal is to build the independents' share to 10 or 11. In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores. The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members. The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger. It ships 115 million titles every year. The online division is also preparing to introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected 1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million. The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are under siege. In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent. Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent. The downturn in sales comes as the economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400 companies. While reluctant to divulge his revenue, Howorth estimates that he sells an average of six books per year for every man, woman, and child in the town of 12,000 residents. The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes & Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and reduce the diversity of materials. He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to all the independent booksellers in his own special way.",

Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris. A British Airways Concorde travels from London to Bahrain, while Air France passengers ride the Concorde from Paris to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the Concorde fleet is aging, it previously had one of the aviation industry's best safety records. It lifted off 13 months later, three months after the Soviet version of the supersonic plane made its first flight. In the 31 years since the first Concorde was rolled out, only a select few have flown on it. The first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out. Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...,'' the control tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds. In 1968, the Concorde's first prototype rolled out at Toulouse, France. The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground. The meeting came a day after French authorities established a special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were killed. British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747. The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years. Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.",

Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris. A British Airways Concorde travels from London to Bahrain, while Air France passengers ride the Concorde from Paris to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the Concorde fleet is aging, it previously had one of the aviation industry's best safety records. It lifted off 13 months later, three months after the Soviet version of the supersonic plane made its first flight. In the 31 years since the first Concorde was rolled out, only a select few have flown on it. The first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out. Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...,'' the control tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds. In 1968, the Concorde's first prototype rolled out at Toulouse, France. The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground. The meeting came a day after French authorities established a special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were killed. British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747. The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years. Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said. Among the mourners were travelers who opted not to take the pricier Concorde across the Atlantic. If so, it will be a long time before elite travelers will again be able to hop across the Atlantic in a mere three hours. Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the crash.

The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet, Russian media reported. Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. The escape hatch they were trying to reach at the rear of the submarine is badly damaged, and repeated efforts to dock have failed. Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine. The multipurpose \"Kursk,\" which was on a training mission as part of Russian Northern Fleet's regular exercises, failed to respond to radio signals at a predetermined time. The navy announces a submarine has suffered a malfunction in the Barents Sea, but says it has only been missing one day. The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea. The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12. Rescuers aborted their first attempt to retrieve the sailors because a storm prevented them from attaching the rescue capsule to an escape hatch, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted navy officials as saying. The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency escape hatch, may be flooded. Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the cripple Kursk is lying. Intensive efforts continued Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday. Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater distances from Russian vessels. While the submarine's sonar equipment allowed the crew to distinguish the explosions, a closer analysis of the recordings had to wait until the tapes reached shore. The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative guide to warships.

                    "summary": " The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore, whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk after Russian efforts failed for days. The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet, Russian media reported. Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. The escape hatch they were trying to reach at the rear of the submarine is badly damaged, and repeated efforts to dock have failed. Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine. The multipurpose \"Kursk,\" which was on a training mission as part of Russian Northern Fleet's regular exercises, failed to respond to radio signals at a predetermined time. The navy announces a submarine has suffered a malfunction in the Barents Sea, but says it has only been missing one day. The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea. The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12. Rescuers aborted their first attempt to retrieve the sailors because a storm prevented them from attaching the rescue capsule to an escape hatch, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted navy officials as saying. The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency escape hatch, may be flooded. Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the cripple Kursk is lying. Intensive efforts continued Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday. Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater distances from Russian vessels. While the submarine's sonar equipment allowed the crew to distinguish the explosions, a closer analysis of the recordings had to wait until the tapes reached shore. The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative guide to warships. Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday. According to the American theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo being loaded or launched as part of an exercise misfired, its engine or its fuel exploding. According to the American officials, neither the two submarines nor the Loyal detected any sounds that would suggest the Kursk had been involved in a collision of any sort. A spokesman said damage to the escape hatch was proving \"an insurmountable obstacle. As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days.",

The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today. Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast. The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example. Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific. It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino. The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events. They built a simple computer model, and almost as an afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia. No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity increases,\" Wang said. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and anecdotal records to study, including when it began.",

The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today. Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast. The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example. Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific. It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino. The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events. They built a simple computer model, and almost as an afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia. No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity increases,\" Wang said. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and anecdotal records to study, including when it began. The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of this \"missing\" carbon dioxide. El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., agreed it will take more study to understand how global warming might affect El Nino.",

The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71 million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to building owners to stay in the program. The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. The wage needed to pay for housing increased in 98 percent of the 3,646 local jurisdictions studied from 1999 to 2000. One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. LIMAC, in turn, was affiliated with Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit that started in 1979 by lending foundation money at below-market rates for housing and community development. Created in 1960, REITs have been used by real estate developers to finance projects from outlet malls and hotels to prisons. Lawmakers hope a bill approved by the House Banking Committee on Friday will counter a trend that is reducing the amount of government-subsidized housing available for the elderly and the disabled. While the United States is enjoying continuing prosperity, affordable housing for many of the working poor has become harder to find, a federal report said Monday. According to the study, evictions increased by 64 percent from 1993 to 1997, and the state also has experienced a 100 percent increase in the number of homeless families since 1990. The report says that increases in immigration and in the number of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase in the housing market for the next decade. The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs. The department is also requesting $283 milion in new low-income housing vouchers to make it easier for 50,000 welfare recipients to find a job. By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself. Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself. Finding affordable housing has also been made more difficult by the fact that a number of apartment owners have sold their properties as condos, taking advantage of the strong real estate market. During this year's primary elections, former rival John McCain handed Bush a resounding defeat in Michigan, largely by luring record numbers of independent voters to the polls. Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. About half of those units are at risk because their rents are below market rates, according to the trust.",

                    "summary": " The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle. The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse. A spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Monday demands that the United States immediately return Cuban Boy Elian Gonzales so that he can reunite with his father. As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno. Florida relatives ask Attorney General Janet Reno to reconsider. Jan. 7 -- Lazaro Gonzalez files petition for temporary custody in state court. As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, asking for temporary custody of the boy. Elian's mother and 10 others perished in late November when their boat sank during a journey from Cuba to the United States. Elian was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck after his mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the Atlantic. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States. Jan. 26 -- Elian's grandmothers meet with him in Miami. June 28 -- Supreme Court rejects appeal; Elian returns home to Cuba. They postponed until Friday a deadline for revoking Elian's parole, which could mean he might soon be taken away from his Miami family, perhaps for a return to Cuba. Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime. The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba. In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana home. Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy, his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor boat. The march of Cuban mothers and grandmothers would be the largest single rally since the beginning of the international custody dispute began after Elian was rescued at sea in late November. Those officials said they would urge Elian's father to remain in the United States until the courts finally decide whether the boy should return to Cuba. Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian should be returned to his father.",

Historian Douglas Brinkley, who is writing a three-volume biography of Carter, said the former president seems at last to be comfortable with the Jimmy Carter life story. LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to monitor the on- going transition program in the country. So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former president and his first lady at the Carter Center. A 35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country. One of his major projects is ensuring that the Carter Center will continue to be a vital force after he and his wife are no longer able to work. Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. The Carter Center said Friday that Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections and demanded that President Alberto Fujimori's government take immediate steps to ensure a clean vote in April. President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections. The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture nascent democracies. The Carter Center set up by Carter had an observation mission during the second multi-party general elections in the southern African country at the weekend. Carter's mother and all three of his siblings have died since he left the White House, so Carter, seeing himself as the patriarch, works to hold the family together. To date, the Carter Center has monitored elections in at least 12 countries, and the inspection of China's villagers' committee over the past two years has proven to be successful. After years of promoting democracy in Latin American countries, the Carter Center now is turning its attention to combating corruption by urging ``transparency,'' or openness, in government. In the statement, Carter said the observation of the transit program was designed \"to support and call international attention to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society. Through the Global 2000 River Blindness Program in collaboration with the National and District Health Services, the center has been involved in the control of river blindness in Uganda since 1996. The Carter Center has been combating another eye disease, river blindness, since 1987 and will expand those programs to additional countries with help from the new grants.",

Historian Douglas Brinkley, who is writing a three-volume biography of Carter, said the former president seems at last to be comfortable with the Jimmy Carter life story. LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to monitor the on- going transition program in the country. So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former president and his first lady at the Carter Center. A 35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country. One of his major projects is ensuring that the Carter Center will continue to be a vital force after he and his wife are no longer able to work. Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. The Carter Center said Friday that Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections and demanded that President Alberto Fujimori's government take immediate steps to ensure a clean vote in April. President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections. The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture nascent democracies. The Carter Center set up by Carter had an observation mission during the second multi-party general elections in the southern African country at the weekend. Carter's mother and all three of his siblings have died since he left the White House, so Carter, seeing himself as the patriarch, works to hold the family together. To date, the Carter Center has monitored elections in at least 12 countries, and the inspection of China's villagers' committee over the past two years has proven to be successful. After years of promoting democracy in Latin American countries, the Carter Center now is turning its attention to combating corruption by urging ``transparency,'' or openness, in government. In the statement, Carter said the observation of the transit program was designed \"to support and call international attention to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society. Through the Global 2000 River Blindness Program in collaboration with the National and District Health Services, the center has been involved in the control of river blindness in Uganda since 1996. The Carter Center has been combating another eye disease, river blindness, since 1987 and will expand those programs to additional countries with help from the new grants. Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic presidential election. Jimmy Carter, who was 52 when he was inaugurated in 1977, will turn 75 on Friday. Pakistan initiated its Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1987, and was the first country in Asia to eradicate the disease two years ahead of the global target. Sudan's dictator was resisting the Carter Center's plan to bring in a program to eradicate guinea worm, a painful, prolonged condition in which worms grow in sufferers' bodies.",
