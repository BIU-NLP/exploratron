Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in Oklahoma, have worked to wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian programs has waned. About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation, including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer some form of gambling. Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes. Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits. With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations.

That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state taxes. After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations. An estimated 50 percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have jobs. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in substandard housing.",

The truants were nowhere to be seen.",

He understood the coded message: steroids. Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of female athletes. Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had thought they were were reversible. Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women. In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids. Substances such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger boost. Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects. Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects. Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance. Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic endurance. The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice. Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages. In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful to athletes. More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread.

Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women. In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids. Substances such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger boost. Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects. Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects. Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance. Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic endurance. The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice. Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages. In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful to athletes. More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread. Bans imposed by international organizations range between two months and life. The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany, with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972 to 40 in 1976. More than 30 Chinese swimmers were caught using drugs in the last decade, including seven at the 1994 Asian Games. Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the 1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the health hazards they pose. Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon.",

                    "summary": " The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all wetlands. Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first \"International Wetlands' Day\" designated by the international wetlands organization. Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988. The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed. The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it. China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of international importance. Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10 acres in any year. Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system. The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years. Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged. Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years. Now more and more people have recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent task. Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and fauna. so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said. The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water. Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's \"kidney\" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land. The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country. In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971. The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and 1996. The Army Corps of Engineers determined the road had violated the federal Clean Water Act. The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that took the Corps to court. The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992, and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued wide-ranging regulations to protect the area. The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project.",

These drugs will treat the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the companies say. Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx. Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters, likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain relievers. McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether all the European studies held up. In the last five years, a better understanding of various rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies. Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation found, despite research showing the value of support groups, exercise classes and other complementary therapies. Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and pain-relieving medicines are used to control them. Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis. It is caused by a defect in body chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes in diet. The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with constant use. New studies show that it may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis. The research, in a report in the current Annals of Behavioral Medicine, suggests that the stress disorder and other kinds of severe psychological stress may actually cause heart disease. The treatment is free to those in the FDA study. It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing how the drug works against different types of pain. For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for cancer treatment). IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are initially for pain relief. aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs. They include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and locally applied linaments and ointments. The patient is convinced that the therapy works. The studies he analyzed compared the supplements with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring any changes in joints. The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis, the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million people nationwide. Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis. Here are a few of the studies' findings:    _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression. Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain.",

                    "summary": " Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly. Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. The system is tied to the antilock brake system. The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the government's chief transportation safety official says few are. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight into drivers' behavior before an accident. Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries. Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively. If all children using child seats were restrained properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency estimated. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly. About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety. In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes. A top federal safety official is urging automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first. The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall. For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element. Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people and vehicles react in accidents. There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle. While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted. The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however. Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too.",

                    "summary": " Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly. Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. The system is tied to the antilock brake system. The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the government's chief transportation safety official says few are. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight into drivers' behavior before an accident. Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries. Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively. If all children using child seats were restrained properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency estimated. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly. About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety. In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes. A top federal safety official is urging automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first. The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall. For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element. Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people and vehicles react in accidents. There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle. While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted. The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however. Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too. Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries. Government officials and auto makers have repeatedly said that wearing seat belts is the most important single way to prevent passengers from being ejected in a rollover crash. AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes. Most manufacturers are installing front-seat side air bags, but only Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Rolls Royce are putting them in the rear seat.",

                    "summary": " Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy. Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if ``winning conditions'' existed. Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence. Opinions show that most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its attention to the economy rather than independence after the referendum. In an editorial, the Montreal daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to governing and tackling the \"very serious social, economic and fiscal problems\" facing Quebeckers. Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful. Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other provinces. Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum. Since that high point for separation, polls in Quebec indicated this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low, around 40 percent. Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive. In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion \"is not allowed to speak for the international community. In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when \"winning conditions\" exist. In the two secession referendums, the proposal was deliberately phrased in ambiguous terms. The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes. Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts. Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said. Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name, said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Mario Dumont. Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated. He will resign as leader of Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal Parliament.",

                    "summary": " Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy. Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if ``winning conditions'' existed. Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence. Opinions show that most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its attention to the economy rather than independence after the referendum. In an editorial, the Montreal daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to governing and tackling the \"very serious social, economic and fiscal problems\" facing Quebeckers. Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful. Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other provinces. Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum. Since that high point for separation, polls in Quebec indicated this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low, around 40 percent. Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive. In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion \"is not allowed to speak for the international community. In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when \"winning conditions\" exist. In the two secession referendums, the proposal was deliberately phrased in ambiguous terms. The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes. Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts. Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said. Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name, said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Mario Dumont. Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated. He will resign as leader of Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal Parliament. Achieving that would be a sign of fiscal responsibility that the separatists would use to build confidence in their ability to lead an independent nation. Quebec is the only province in Canada that does not allow drivers to make a right turn at a red light. The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 75 seats in Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the latest reports from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.",

                    "summary": " About Evolution and the Nature of Science. The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of science. The science standards have yet to reach school districts. Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from Arkansas City, who rejects evolution. Those standards present evolution as a major component of science. The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. The Supreme Court in 1987 barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism in public schools where evolution is taught, calling such a Louisiana law a thinly veiled attempt to promote religion. Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness: the Bible. According to several polls, including one reported recently in Scientific American, about 40 percent of scientists believe in God. In a recent survey of 387 Louisiana biology teachers, Aguillard found that 24 percent believed in creationism and 29 percent believed it was appropriate for high school biology classes. Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution. They list evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines. There are ``creation scientists'' who argue that the Bible can be squared with scientific observations of, for example, the age of the universe. Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists'' such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Most creationists say that scientific theories must be observable. Those who take the biblical account of creation literally reject the scientific method, offering instead a doctrine of faith. Most start their classes by discussing the differences between science and religion, and talk about the limits of science and the fact that theories are always subject to correction and change. Ham has his own staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other underpinnings of modern science. Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern biology. She rejects the evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living things share common ancestors. Creationists view that similarity as more proof of design, Kailer said. Some support the notion of natural selection as one of God's tools. On the one hand, groups like the National Academy of Sciences say that evolution should be taught with no mention of the biblical version of creation. To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible, Genesis. The Big Bang theory, based on decades of astronomical observations and physics research, suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion of matter and radiation some 15 billion years ago. The Kansas board also took aim at the science of the cosmos, voting to delete from its standards the Big Bang theory of how the universe originated around 15 billion years ago.",

The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic. During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill. Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev. The Chechens say 550 civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians Thursday. Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks. Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from \"peaceful areas\" to the Chechen border areas. At the completion of the first stage of its campaign against Chechen rebels, federal forces have now taken control a third of Chechnya, mostly low-lying areas north of the Terek River. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital, although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996. In the course of the combat actions in Chechnya that began on October 1, 1999, the federal force have registered 2,240 people killed and 6,372 wounded.",

                    "summary": " The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday. Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya. Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since Russia began its offensive in September. Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech. The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic. During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill. Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev. The Chechens say 550 civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians Thursday. Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks. Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from \"peaceful areas\" to the Chechen border areas. At the completion of the first stage of its campaign against Chechen rebels, federal forces have now taken control a third of Chechnya, mostly low-lying areas north of the Terek River. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital, although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996. In the course of the combat actions in Chechnya that began on October 1, 1999, the federal force have registered 2,240 people killed and 6,372 wounded. The militants, who want to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Russia, entered Dagestan and fought Russian forces in August and September. After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the northern flatlands. Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya. Russian generals have hinted that they plan to partition Chechnya and slowly push the rebel fighters into the mountains south of Grozny. Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya two weeks ago, raising fears of another all-out war there. Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended in political deadlock.",

The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path clearance as the EgyptAir plane. Murad further demanded that Egypt receive the plane's wreck and the two black boxes, recording flight and voice data, for re- examination, the pro-government newspaper said. the aircraft _ were turned off from the cockpit shutdown, a scenario that puzzled commercial airline pilots and aviation specialists. An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed. Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder contained words that may have been a prayer just before the plane went into its plunge. A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew know immediately that the autopilot was off, he said. EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff October 31 from New York airport, killing 217 people on board. The EgyptAir passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast on October 31, killing all 217 aboard. For example, when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after takeoff from Lima in 1996, the cockpit voice recorder captured the desperate conversation of the two pilots. Both engines on the Boeing 767 were also turned off. Pilots experienced with the Boeing 767, the type of plane that crashed, said they could not understand why the engines had been turned off, with the information now in hand. Hall said substantial portions of the wings, tail, fuselage and an engine had been recovered. The Boeing 767 climbed back to 24,000 feet, only to dive again rapidly toward the Atlantic, this time breaking up when it reached about 10,000 feet. The jet climbed back to 24,000 feet before making a rapid descent to 10,000 feet. Preliminary investigation found that someone in the cockpit uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged and the plane started its fatal plunge. All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the Atlantic less than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected.. All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash. The Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board. The NTSB would remain the lead agency in the investigation if the cause of the Oct. 31 crash of the Boeing 767-300ER is found to be mechanical or pilot error. Kato added that it was apparent from the air traffic control transcript that no FAA controller was actually watching the Flight 990 at the time of the accident and for several minutes after. EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on October 31, killing all 217 people on board. The jet crashed 40 minutes into its 11-hour flight, killing all 217 aboard.",

The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school.

The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff. Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance cameras. Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds. Warning signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an oppressive air to schools. The officials said that while educators and law enforcement officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future random attack is extremely difficult. Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the wake of Columbine.",

The officials said that while educators and law enforcement officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future random attack is extremely difficult. Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the wake of Columbine. Many districts conducted highly publicized drills over the summer in which police SWAT teams entered schools to put down mock shootings. The Kent SWAT team has also trained in schools after hours. The parent councils Cellucci mentioned also include school principals, teachers, and, in some cases, community leaders and students. Instead, these administrators have begun conducting intensive seminars to train students and teachers to recognize and defuse threats before they lead to violence. School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting of campus crime would help administrators get a better understanding of the problems they face and allow for early intervention. GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track incidents of school violence and other crimes. In that incident last April, two students stormed into Columbine and killed a dozen classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents were reported. Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic, may not offer the only _ or the best _ hope at preventing violence at school. Methods of security tend to vary as broadly as parenting techniques, reflecting a lack of consensus on the best ways to reduce violence.",

                    "summary": " Chicago school officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform policies in many of their schools. Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms. The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director. In Deltona, Fla., near Orlando, lockers have been removed and book bags banned; students will get a duplicate set of books to keep at home. Now school officials are talking about mandating clear book bags, or no bookbags, a dress code, even metal detectors -- ideas that until now had been soundly rejected. The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff. Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance cameras. Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds. Warning signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an oppressive air to schools. The officials said that while educators and law enforcement officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future random attack is extremely difficult. Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the wake of Columbine.

He also discussed creating emergency plans for schools that would include everyone, from the local police to the school bus drivers. To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts, experts and educators say.",

Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in 1993. Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated racism. I acknowledge that we have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment,'' he added. Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged again because they were acquitted. Because the initial investigation was so flawed, the prosecution of three of the five suspects failed to win convictions and crown prosecutors dropped the cases against the other two. Stephen, 18, was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in southeast London in 1993. Black teeager Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a bus-stop in Eltham, south London by five white youngsters six years ago. None of the five white suspects was successfully prosecuted. She added that they had been arrested \"in the vicinity of the alleged theft. The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with information about the slaying to contact police. Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk, the report said. The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform. The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena, a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital.",

Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.

The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out the rules. Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud. The Canadian government today announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The convention will come into force in these provinces on April 1, 1997. The United States is among 11 original signatories to the pact that have not ratified it. The ratification of the convention has also made it necessary to amend the federal immigration regulations. The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high. The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to harmonize the practices of different countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year. Although scattered international adoptions took place after World War II, families in which the children looked markedly different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War.",

                    "summary": " ) _ Chinese couples will find it easier and foreigners perhaps more difficult to adopt children under a revised adoption law approved by China's legislature Wednesday, state media reported. In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different: it is for parents. In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. Now, suddenly, adoption agencies are telling them that they can't be sure when they'll get their children. Fewer orphans have lost both parents because of war; instead, many come from families that cannot afford them. Meanwhile, some adoptees think adoptive parents can approach the job of educating their children with too much zeal. BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China will not impose more restrictions on Chinese children adopted by foreigners but will have more detailed and standardized adoption procedures, legislators said here today. Foreign couples, especially Americans, are scrambling to adopt children in case a new government tightens adoption rules. The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993. The original version of the law introduced in parliament earlier in the year said that Russia must sign agreements with other countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept. 1, 1999. The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud. Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday. The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out the rules. Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud.

The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to harmonize the practices of different countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year. Although scattered international adoptions took place after World War II, families in which the children looked markedly different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War. One of the radical turn-abouts in adoption Sunday is that adoptive parents are given the opposite advice: to embrace their children's background and incorporate it into their lives. Though every adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the issue of group identity.",

                    "summary": " Millions of American children take drugs daily to calm hyperactivity, but medical science has been uncertain how the drugs affect the brain. Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD, and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated with stimulant drugs in the past year. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six months. ADHD is currently diagnosed according to a set of guidelines written by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Severe marital stress or financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe anxiety. It is believed to calm hyperactivity by helping children's brains disregard distracting stimuli, such as classroom noise, so they can focus on learning. Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. An estimated 2 million children in the United States have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and hyperactivity. A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. It will appear in the July 1999 Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still. Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting. Once considered to afflict only children, the disorders are now said to have been diagnosed in 3 percent to 5 percent of adults, too. Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years. In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage. Publicity about ADD and its cousin, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many people with the disorders more aware of their condition. Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine have a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood. She said a drug cocktail including Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate. The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone. What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat behavior rather than disease. Adderall, a mixture of two types of amphetamines, initially was developed as a weight loss drug in the 1960s and later fell out of use. In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent.",

                    "summary": " Smith found digital fingerprints linking the virus writer called VicodinES to that virus. When a new virus like Melissa appears, it could slip past any antivirus program that has not been updated to catch it. No matter how it arrives, Melissa can infect any computer that uses Microsoft Word, including Macintoshes (but Macs cannot pass it along via Outlook). Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected computers of several organizations. Although most of the newer viruses arrive as e-mail attachments, viruses can come from any number of sources, including commercial, shrink-wrapped software. It can also travel via diskettes and downloaded files, but electronic mail is an exquisitely more efficient carrier, given the millions of e-mail messages that traverse computer networks every day. We are entering the plague years of computer viruses. Melissa has focused the computing world's attention on the rapidly growing threat of computer viruses in the Internet era and underscored the need of all PC users to take virus protection seriously. Smith also discovered that in December 1997, the same America Online account that sent out Melissa had posted a similar virus. Since the Melissa virus lurks inside a Microsoft Word document, Smith hoped he could identify its author by reading Melissa's serial number. Gets in via e-mail, floppies or downloaded software. Liu Xu, an anti-virus expert, suggested computer users delete the virus with anti-virus software before December 13 or change the date. There is even one that can alter your system and notify the hacker via e-mail when your computer is vulnerable to further attacks. No computer connected to the Internet should be without one. The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the internet. The Wazzu virus, another macro virus that infects Word documents, was responsible for about one-fifth of all infections. If you do execute it, it quietly insinuates itself amongst your Internet programs and attaches itself to every message you send. An antivirus program is designed to recognize telltale virus signatures and to intercept and destroy the rogue code before it has a chance to infect the computer. It took only days earlier this spring for authorities to trace the digital footprints of Melissa and the Chernobyl virus that struck in late April. Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was ordered to delete the thing on sight. It generally gets into your computer by way of an attachment to an e-mail. It also contaminates a computer's e-mail program and sends a copy of itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail. Some of these viruses can reformat your hard disk drive, permanently erasing all the files on it. Get in the habit of making regular backups.",

Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent. Each month sales were down 20 percent from the same time the year before. The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association. The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members. It ships 115 million titles every year. For example, the unit sales of books about science and technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in 1995, falling 8 percent to 74 million copies last year. After nurturing their shops into a profitable existence, local entrepreneurs in Mississippi and other points around the country are struggling against chain stores offering cheaper prices. The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. At the university level sales grew more than 19 percent, to 176 million copies, between 1993 and 1998. In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent. Mail order companies like Readers Digest that have suffered from a free fall in sales, which have plunged as much as 20 percent from a year earlier. Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods, independents are fighting back any way they can. The state and national booksellers associations maintain that the three on-line booksellers have a formidable presence in California and that should count as an established nexus. The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes & Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and reduce the diversity of materials.",

Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association. Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes & Noble to learn what others are buying. The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes & Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the world's largest book distributor. The most recent statistics from the Association of American Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their own, but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as online booksellers. The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger. Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion. In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed.

Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed grounded as the investigation    progressed Thursday. Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble. Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde. Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747. British Airways has continued to fly its fleet of Concordes. British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people. British Airways, the only other airliner to operate the Concorde, suspended its flights on August 15. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. That's why people pay $10,000 round-trip for the abbreviated experience. Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings. The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at breathtaking speed. The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground. Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people. Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air France took the unsold planes in 1979. British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday. Investigators in France reported Wednesday, that the pilot of Concorde Flight AF4590 reported the failure of one engine that had been repaired earlier in the day. The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a refueling problem.",

Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed grounded as the investigation    progressed Thursday. Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble. Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde. Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747. British Airways has continued to fly its fleet of Concordes. British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people. British Airways, the only other airliner to operate the Concorde, suspended its flights on August 15. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. That's why people pay $10,000 round-trip for the abbreviated experience. Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings. The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at breathtaking speed. The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground. Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people. Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air France took the unsold planes in 1979. British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday. Investigators in France reported Wednesday, that the pilot of Concorde Flight AF4590 reported the failure of one engine that had been repaired earlier in the day. The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a refueling problem. A Concorde operated by Air France flies around the world in a record time of 32 hours and 49 minutes. So millions of air travelers will have to be content with moving around the world at a pokey 600 miles an hour. The question has haunted the relatives of those who died since the supersonic jet crashed shortly after takeoff outside Paris last month, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground. Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the crash.",

MOSCOW _ Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a diving capsule Tuesday to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a sunken Russian nuclear submarine. Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the cripple Kursk is lying. The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea. In the most serious incident, the Tautog, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, collided in 1970 with a Soviet submarine close to Russia's Pacific coast. The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12. The authorities said most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes of the disaster, and that any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled with water. Putin also has ordered that an operation be conducted to raise the wreck of the Kursk from its resting place 350 feet below the surface, Klebanov said. Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight.

Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine. Top officials give contradictory reports on state of Kursk and chances of survivors. As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days. The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency escape hatch, may be flooded. As a result, the capsules and other devices are sliding off the vessel's hull, he said. The multipurpose submarine went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet. The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision. The Kursk sank on Aug. 12 after massive explosions. MOSCOW _ Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a diving capsule Tuesday to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a sunken Russian nuclear submarine. Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the cripple Kursk is lying. The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea. In the most serious incident, the Tautog, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, collided in 1970 with a Soviet submarine close to Russia's Pacific coast. The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12. The authorities said most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes of the disaster, and that any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled with water. Putin also has ordered that an operation be conducted to raise the wreck of the Kursk from its resting place 350 feet below the surface, Klebanov said. Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight. Intensive efforts continued Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday. Military officials claim the most likely scenario is that the Kursk struck another vessel, probably a foreign submarine. The Kursk was rising to the surface, possibly preparing to fire a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck. The escape hatch they were trying to reach at the rear of the submarine is badly damaged, and repeated efforts to dock have failed. A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway.",

El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South. By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts. True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast. The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida. La Ninas, by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers?'' he said. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events. The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming. El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six years. The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called La Nina, he added. Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer models. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success.",

                    "summary": " The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that dissipated in 1998. El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South. By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts. True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast. The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida. La Ninas, by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers?'' he said. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events. The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming. El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six years. The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called La Nina, he added. Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer models. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of this \"missing\" carbon dioxide. Analysis with medical imaging technology found that El Nino appeared every two to eight years, the same frequency as today. Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., agreed it will take more study to understand how global warming might affect El Nino.",

The Housing Authority then buys a third of the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing. Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy. The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. The wage needed to pay for housing increased in 98 percent of the 3,646 local jurisdictions studied from 1999 to 2000. HUD also has increased fair market rents in certain high-income areas, in effect, increasing the value of the rental voucher. A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts. The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income. In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides. The report says that increases in immigration and in the number of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase in the housing market for the next decade. That's a failed formula of the past, the concentration of poverty, in some cases the super-concentration of poverty. Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. Moreover, upper-income black and Latino applicants were denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income bracket. By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. HUD researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993. In addition, the report says, the brisk housing market has also driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor and those newly off of welfare. Low-income housing is a local issue that should be placed in the hands of the private sector, said Hudgins.",

                    "summary": " Today's predicament in housing differs significantly from that of the 1980s, when the state's housing market experienced a similar upturn, housing advocates say. The Housing Authority then buys a third of the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing. Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy. The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. The wage needed to pay for housing increased in 98 percent of the 3,646 local jurisdictions studied from 1999 to 2000. HUD also has increased fair market rents in certain high-income areas, in effect, increasing the value of the rental voucher. A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts. The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income. In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides. The report says that increases in immigration and in the number of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase in the housing market for the next decade. That's a failed formula of the past, the concentration of poverty, in some cases the super-concentration of poverty. Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. Moreover, upper-income black and Latino applicants were denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income bracket. By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. HUD researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993. In addition, the report says, the brisk housing market has also driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor and those newly off of welfare. Low-income housing is a local issue that should be placed in the hands of the private sector, said Hudgins. Rental rates have risen at one and a half times the rate of inflation in the past three years, according to HUD's State of the Cities 2000 report. Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself. Families pay 30 percent of their incomes for rent; HUD covers the difference between what tenants pay and the cost of maintaining the apartments. One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.",

Elian has been separated from his father long enough. Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five hours Wednesday night, and will resume talks Thursday. Castro had promised that Cuba would avoid a media circus upon Elian's return to Cuba. Florida relatives ask Attorney General Janet Reno to reconsider. President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling. Jan. 7 -- Lazaro Gonzalez files petition for temporary custody in state court. As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno. Elian survived a boat sinking that killed his mother and 10 others. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank as they fled Cuba. In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son could grow up in freedom. The Miami relatives have fought to keep Elian with them in the United States, arguing that they can give him a better life off the communist island. June 28 -- Supreme Court rejects appeal; Elian returns home to Cuba. Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy, his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor boat. Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime. The high court also refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the country. Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the view of immigration officials.",

Elian has been separated from his father long enough. Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five hours Wednesday night, and will resume talks Thursday. Castro had promised that Cuba would avoid a media circus upon Elian's return to Cuba. Florida relatives ask Attorney General Janet Reno to reconsider. President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling. Jan. 7 -- Lazaro Gonzalez files petition for temporary custody in state court. As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno. Elian survived a boat sinking that killed his mother and 10 others. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank as they fled Cuba. In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son could grow up in freedom. The Miami relatives have fought to keep Elian with them in the United States, arguing that they can give him a better life off the communist island. June 28 -- Supreme Court rejects appeal; Elian returns home to Cuba. Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy, his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor boat. Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime. The high court also refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the country. Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the view of immigration officials. Nov. 25 -- Elian rescued at sea two or three days after boat capsizes, killing his mother and 10 others. Elian was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck after his mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the Atlantic. The court ruling, which could be appealed, is considered a critical step in the international custody dispute that has lasted for nearly five months. Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately.",
