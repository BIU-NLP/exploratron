                    "summary": " The Navajo Reservation is primarily dependent on federal money. Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations. Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in Oklahoma, have worked to wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian programs has waned. About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation, including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer some form of gambling. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty. Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City metropolitan area. From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native American population has more than doubled. Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes. To some degree, state and federal officials are responding. Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new era. In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs. As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away. So the Makah are turning for advice to other indigenous whalers. The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning. Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years. Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the Navajo Nation. This is up from around 3,000 just seven years ago. Thirty years ago, up to three dozen Indians practiced law. Poverty among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota makes theirs the poorest county in the country. Two-thirds of the American Indian population belong to poverty-stricken tribes that still don't have Las Vegas-style casinos.",

                    "summary": " The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all wetlands. Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first \"International Wetlands' Day\" designated by the international wetlands organization. Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988. The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed. The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions. Finland has funded a number of environmental protection projects in the province, and has exhibited special interest in flora and fauna protection programs. The Army Corps of Engineers determined the road had violated the federal Clean Water Act. They maintain a fifth of those losses have been due to the Army Corps building permit policies. Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their projects. The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental stewardship, has acted responsibly. Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl. DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act. The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project. Meanwhile, homebuilders and the National Association of Counties have accused the Corps of overreaction. The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands. By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before undertaking the expansion. The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms. Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge sewage and conserve water, according to experts. The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is divided into two major sections -- Beihai Marshland and Qinghai Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation. The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory birds. After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will plant bull rushes and other wetland plants. These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations. The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation last month. The province and Finland have established a cooperative committee and work plan focusing on environmental protection.",

These drugs will treat the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the companies say. Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx. Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters, likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain relievers. McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether all the European studies held up. The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Among the most common types of arthritis:    OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease. While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments -- aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant side effects. The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects. 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin in three doses. Proponents theorize that taking extra glucosamine stimulates new cartilage production, while chondroitin slows its destruction. aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs. Mainstream practitioners also usually recommend anti-inflammatory drugs. Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis. Centocor Inc. used the meeting to show its experimental drug Remicade also provides relief from rheumatoid arthritis. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001. The Food and Drug Administration also steers clear of such remedies. Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. They include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and locally applied linaments and ointments. Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.

                    "summary": " About Evolution and the Nature of Science. The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of science. The science standards have yet to reach school districts. Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from Arkansas City, who rejects evolution. Those standards present evolution as a major component of science. The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. Teaching biology without evolution is like teaching physics while ignoring gravity, they say. They list evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines. In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools. Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely the teaching of evolution in public schools. The board and the state education commissioner appointed the 27-member committee to write the standards. The Kansas Board of Education dictates much of what is taught in the state's public schools. Abrams' revision removed the unifying concepts and added three areas of science: technology, theoretical science and historical science. At the forefront of this discussion are Kansas' new science curriculum standards. Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson helped write. In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the governor. Abrams' proposal casts theory as conjecture, placing applied science above understanding how things work, said Williamson, an Olathe East High School science teacher. , the New Mexico Board of Education voted overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum to the teaching of evolution. Creationists view that similarity as more proof of design, Kailer said. Proponents of ``intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too complex to have been created by random processes. There are seven people on the Pratt school district board. Lutes, superintendent of the Elkhart School District, told the board that the committee used guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences to frame the Kansas standards. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri sent a letter to the superintendents of each of the state's 304 school districts. The standards are guidelines for school districts to use as they determine what students should learn. Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that Earth is billions of years old, and that life forms developed gradually several million years ago. If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans.",

                    "summary": " The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday. Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya. Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since Russia began its offensive in September. The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday. Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday. The official said rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya planned such blasts against armored personnel carriers of federal troops. The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative, Kazantsev said. Chechnya's Defense Minister Magomed Khambiyev said specially trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news agencies here reported. The actions of Russia's air force are in compliance with a program approved by the General Staff of the Russian armed forces,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic's border with Dagestan. Authorities believe Chechen rebels masterminded the terrorist attacks. Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts. He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks. Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately, turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies. Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals. Islamic militants from Chechnya launched two waves of assaults on Daghestan since August. Putin blames the fighters for a series of terrorist bomb blasts in Russia that killed some 300 people.",

                    "summary": " The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday. Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya. Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since Russia began its offensive in September. The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday. Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday. The official said rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya planned such blasts against armored personnel carriers of federal troops. The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative, Kazantsev said. Chechnya's Defense Minister Magomed Khambiyev said specially trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news agencies here reported. The actions of Russia's air force are in compliance with a program approved by the General Staff of the Russian armed forces,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic's border with Dagestan. Authorities believe Chechen rebels masterminded the terrorist attacks. Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts. He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks. Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately, turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies. Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals. Islamic militants from Chechnya launched two waves of assaults on Daghestan since August. Putin blames the fighters for a series of terrorist bomb blasts in Russia that killed some 300 people. This is a necessary measure,\" said Col. General Ivan Golubev, Russian deputy interior minister and commander of the Interior Ministry's force in the North Caucasus. The casualties included eight Defense Ministry servicemen and 17 policemen from the Interior Ministry, according to Col. General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the General Staff. In Grozny, Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov claimed Sunday that the Russian military conceal their losses in Chechnya. Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya.",

Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms. The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director.",

Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms. The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director. Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around with identification badges. The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff. It defined deadly school violence as killings of adults as well as children on school property. Lawrence Middle School has a bullying policy. Many schools have resorted to scare signs or metal detectors or surveillance cameras. The new building will not, however, be equipped with any metal detectors. There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents were reported. City schools closed last week after the arrest of four students who allegedly planned a massacre similar to Colorado's Columbine High School slayings will reopen Monday. Michael Dorn, school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council. Hunterdon Central Regional High School has practiced evacuation drills. Now districts are moving up timetables for training school staff, said Pegi McEvoy, the Seattle district's safety coordinator. Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a police officer or sheriff's deputy. After Thursday's shootings, Cobb County school officials are considering asking for additional police support in the schools. Federal officials still say schools are safe. One such survey of high-school age students released Tuesday by the Horatio Alger Association showed 37 percent feel safe in school, down from 44 percent last year. None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban schools. Like many other schools preparing for this week's anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, Rich East High School in Park Forest, Ill., will have extra police officers on hand. In the month since the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., a sense of foreboding has enveloped schools across the country.",

                    "summary": " The Metropolitan Police in London, which investigated the death of the black 18-year-old, faces one of the toughest challenges. The new measures would focus on tackling \"institutionalized racism\" in the police service, with a shake up of training and procedures. The murder of Lawrence, 18, has put police under scrutiny like never before. An official report last year condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism. LONDON Stephen Lawrence was the picture of a typical English lad. The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign. Two suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder case and one other man were arrested Monday on suspicion of theft by Kent Police, police said. Metropolitan police Assistant Commissioner David Vaness said police feared ``a continuing series of vicious attacks,'' possibly spreading to other cities. Straw told the parliament that he had ordered an immediate inspection of the London Metropolitan police force by the Inspectorate of Constabulary. Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence. A group of 29 British rights organizations said the revised laws create racial tensions rather than racial harmony. The commission was calling for reform of the Race Relations Act to include the police, and said there must be a determination to make racial equality a reality. The mother of a black British teen-ager slain by white youths presented Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement award Thursday in recognition of his fight to end apartheid. Black boys are four times more likely to be excluded from school than their white peers. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him. She was referring to white supremacist David Copeland. A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a more active role in combating racial intolerance. At a news conference, Condon accepted the findings, including the new definition of institutional racism. Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, believes the Lawrence case will leave an indelible mark. The British government rejected Calls on Friday for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case. On Wednesday, Home Secretary Jack Straw stood solemnly in Parliament to report the findings. Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week. Black teeager Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a bus-stop in Eltham, south London by five white youngsters six years ago. The parents of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against the men suspected of his killing.",

In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the House measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally. If all goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally relinquishes the child. Juan and Keila Aguablanca were spared that fate when their parents left them in a public health clinic three days after their Feb. 11 birth. Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process. The implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions. Pregnant women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. Xinhua reported that the revised law requires prospective adoptive parents from abroad to provide extensive information on their background _ all notarized by authorities in their home countries. The frontier state for the adoption business is California. Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions passed the House on Tuesday after months of gridlock over whether it would allow gay adoptions.",

Dennis, who has attention deficit disorder, promptly panicked. In 1987, the diagnosis was expanded to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me. A pediatrician diagnosed Kyle with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and prescribed a trial run of Ritalin. An estimated 2 million children in the United States have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and hyperactivity. Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.",

When a new virus like Melissa appears, it could slip past any antivirus program that has not been updated to catch it. No matter how it arrives, Melissa can infect any computer that uses Microsoft Word, including Macintoshes (but Macs cannot pass it along via Outlook). Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected computers of several organizations. Liu Xu, an anti-virus expert, suggested computer users delete the virus with anti-virus software before December 13 or change the date. The virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a computer's hard drive. Get an anti-virus program and use it. The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the internet. CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated. I use Symantec's Norton Antivirus for both my Windows and Macintosh computers. Richard Smith got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan, a 19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of Delaware. On Monday, Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., made a phone call to the FBI. Most are programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs. We are entering the plague years of computer viruses. Because of the way it replicates, Worm. Proving even more virulent than first believed, the computer virus Worm. People who read the document using Microsoft Word, the popular word-processing program made by Microsoft Corp., could infect their computers. Melissa typically enters a computer hidden in a Microsoft Word 97 or Word 2000 file attached to an electronic mail message. A company unknowingly distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet. Both companies have developed software that detects and disables the virus. When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other files on their hard drive. Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows operating systems. Zip actually does not fit the technical definition of a computer virus. Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip.",

The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes & Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the world's largest book distributor.

Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association. Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes & Noble to learn what others are buying. The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes & Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the world's largest book distributor. Barnes & Noble, however, had said the acquisition would have allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes & Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost. Lemuria is one of 26 plaintiffs in the action against Barnes & Noble and Borders. The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association. The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger. The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members. Booksellers, publishers, agents and authors are gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center for this year's BookExpo America. The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers' group, Blackboard, Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in her mid-20s. Two leading distributors, Publishers Group West in California and the National Book Network in Maryland, are buying heavily these days. The American Booksellers Association, with a core membership of some 3,300 independent stores, voted Saturday at BookExpo America to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment. Ms. Wynne said recently while taking a break at an American Booksellers Association meeting in San Francisco. 500,000 last May. These gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer one-click ordering. Even GAIA, part of which functions as a nonprofit community center, is developing a Web site that will allow its techno-savvy customers to buy online. During the convention, the sale of Random House to the Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw that as bad news. Bertelsmann AG's successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention. The chief executive of the online venture will remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes & Noble, whose roots are in traditional bookselling. During the summer, Barnes & Noble hired several top executives for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer, and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies. Meanwhile, the industry also talked books, the paper kind. The Book-of-the-Month Club sells general hardcover titles, but it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book Club. That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied association of bookstore proprietors. When bookstore owner Michael Powell arrived at BookExpo America his schedule included leading a seminar on electronic publishing.",

Four people on the ground and all 109 people in the plane were killed. The 747 has only grown to carry more people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain. Chunks of the tire ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines, which ignited escaping fuel. The Concorde is outfitted with seven fuel tanks in each wing.",

Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine. Top officials give contradictory reports on state of Kursk and chances of survivors. As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days. The sailors are trapped 354 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea in the Arctic circle. Two Norwegian ships are heading for the disaster area one the British LR5 submarine rescue craft and the other a group of Norwegian deep-sea divers. , Russian Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov told the RTR state television. Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov is overseeing the rescue operation, which is aimed at raising the submarine to the surface and evacuating its crew. British and Norwegian rescue crews head for Russia on ships. The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. The military said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. This blast was probably torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating. Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons. A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing fainter. Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the incident, told reporters that the disaster with the sub \"was developing two minutes,\" the Itar-Tass news agency reported. The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight. The Kursk sank on Aug. 12 after massive explosions. A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine crashes to the bottom of the Barents Sea during naval exercises. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,'' the Interfax news agency reported. CNN reported that the Russians had informally approached NATO officials to ask about the possibility of assistance.",

El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South. By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts. La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos. Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers?'' he said. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees. Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of trade winds; and changes in sea level. El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year. Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. Wetter conditions than usual will continue over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern South America. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African weather experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping to hit South Africa stronger than ever before. By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the International dateline, WMO said. Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. The program said experiments on the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian claims.",

                    "summary": " The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that dissipated in 1998. El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South. By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts. La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos. Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers?'' he said. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees. Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of trade winds; and changes in sea level. El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year. Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas. He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. Wetter conditions than usual will continue over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern South America. La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African weather experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping to hit South Africa stronger than ever before. By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the International dateline, WMO said. Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. The program said experiments on the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian claims. El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six years. If La Nina dissipates before it hits Los Angeles, the area could face a more typical wet winter. It disrupts weather worldwide, causing storms, floods and droughts. The weather-altering La Nina phenomenon has all but vanished from the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA satellite observations.",
