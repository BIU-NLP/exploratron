As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians under age 20. Federal lawmakers also soon must sort out the muddled state of American Indian gambling, which has pitted tribes desperate for casino revenue against state governments resistant to gambling. Indian tribes are in court fighting for the right to establish multistate bingo, lottery and casino games that offer big jackpots. A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear. When American Indians began embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s, the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site. Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new era. Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New York area. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty. An Indian-made product sold on Indian land is exempt from state taxes. It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said. Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical. The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country. The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the Navajo Nation. Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops, traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation. The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers. Congress' General Accounting Office estimates that 40 percent of Indian gambling revenue comes from eight of 184 tribal casinos. Jacob Coin, former executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association, said that's because 75 percent of jobs in tribal casinos are held by non-Indians. Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said. So often, reservations appeared all but worthless until oil or some other bonanza was discovered.",

                    "summary": " Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction under the nationwide permit system. Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection. He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources. The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions. DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act. They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers. China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of international importance. Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and fauna. Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system. East China's Anhui Province is working to seek international cooperation for protecting local wetland resources, which are shrinking in size and deteriorating, a threat posed by varied human factors. The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe. Local sources report that effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands, Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in southwest China's Yunnan Province. Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl. The province intends to introduce overseas technology, facilities and money to do such research works on wetlands environment, waterfowl resources, and migratory birds. Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership between government and non-government interests to work for the goal of wetlands conservation. The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms. Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge sewage and conserve water, according to experts. The Clinton administration Thursday proposed new rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from development, a response to what administration officials called a recent rash of destruction. After years of deliberations, the Clinton administration next week will impose tougher requirements on developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands, according to sources familiar with the new regulations. Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's \"kidney\" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land. Wetlands are a kind of ecosystem, including lakes and marshlands, with ecological and economic functions such as storing floodwater for use against drought. The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau. After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will plant bull rushes and other wetland plants.",

The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers. It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and whether they actually attack the underlying disease. Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis drugs. Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx. Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or NSAIDs for arthritis and other pains. aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs. There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain. Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla., suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx. May. Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach. drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen. That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example, cyclosporin. Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen. Robert DeLap, director of an FDA office of drug evaluation, told the Journal that more research needs to be done before coming to a conclusion about Celebrex's safety. Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001. They offer the same pain relief as traditional arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and intestinal bleeding. Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for rheumatic patients. Monsanto will be first to sell a revolutionary type of arthritis medication, but its battle with Merck & Co. in the high stakes painkiller drug wars is far from over. Even as new medications are relieving arthritis symptoms without upsetting stomachs, an Arthritis Foundation survey shows that misconceptions by both doctors and patients are holding people back from treatment that might help. The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis. Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and pain-relieving medicines are used to control them.

The government announced new air bag standards Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small adults. Indeed, in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a child safety seat. With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have. Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly. Safety experts recommend that small infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of an air bag. The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying positions.

In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when \"winning conditions\" exist.

Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because \"people in Quebec don't want any referendum,\" Chretien said. Signs that prominently feature the blue and white fleur-de-lis flag, the provocative symbol of the Quebec separatist movement, this time belong to the anti-separation Liberal Party and its leader, Jean Charest.

OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is set to hear the case of Quebec separation in early December, according to a draft agenda released today. Canada's federal government initiated the court case 18 months ago in a bid to lay down legal rules for the political battle over Quebec separation. Quebec is the country's second most populous province, after Ontario. Quebec Liberals and Parti Quebecois legislators may adopt a common front against the bill. Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year, when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars of damage. The real battle for Quebec is being fought in the St. Lawrence River valley between Montreal and the provincial capital, in faded centers such as Trois Rivieres, Longueuil, and Cap-de-la-Madeline. The heckling became so bad that police intervened, hustling Alliance Quebec leader William Johnson into a paddy wagon and driving him away. Prime Minister Jean Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in helping strengthen Quebec's economy and social services. English-speaking Quebecers are bunched in Montreal and the Eastern Townships. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said people in the French-speaking province of Quebec are facing reality about the consequences of separation.",

Staver, however, said he believed the changes approved remove evolution as a unifying concept tying the sciences together. A new curriculum it approved removed evolution from the state tests that students have to take.",

He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel bases, but Chechnya's government accuses the Russians of indiscrimately hitting civilian targets. Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays. The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday. Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks. Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks. Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections. Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya. During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill. As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby. Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts. Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military, but Yastrzhembsky said it's \"nothing new. Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives.",

                    "summary": " Speaking in the southern Russian town of Vladikavkaz, Viktor Kazantsev, commander of Russian forces in North Caucasus region that includes Chechnya, said there was no order to take Grozny. He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions. Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel bases, but Chechnya's government accuses the Russians of indiscrimately hitting civilian targets. Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays. The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday. Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks. Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks. Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections. Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya. During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill. As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby. Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts. Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military, but Yastrzhembsky said it's \"nothing new. Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals. Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya. The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. They have been linked to terrorist bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities this month.",

Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds. After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction in school crime and an increase in attendance.

                    "summary": " A bomb was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four students at the school. The guide tells school officials, parents and citizens how to prepare an action plan for detecting, preventing and responding to threats and crises in the schools. The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff. Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around with identification badges. The two Columbine High School students who attacked their Littleton, Colo., classmates left notes that detailed their feelings of alienation. Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms. With television crews broadcasting the frightened faces of Heritage students, a collective angst swept through many schools and homes. After Thursday's shootings, Cobb County school officials are considering asking for additional police support in the schools. Chicago school officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform policies in many of their schools. Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating students' rights when imposing penalties. Schneider, of the superintendents' group, said the shaping of a new relationship with the local police department was probably the most common step adopted by the nation's school districts. While school safety measures such as metal detectors or additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the cost of the software to be less than $2 per student. Michael Dorn, school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council. Ellen Boylan, an attorney at the Education Law Center who handles students-rights cases, said zero-tolerance policies illegally keep students from receiving educations and don't result in safer schools. While schools cannot ensure safety, they can enact strategies that make schools safer, he said. None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban schools. New software that helps highlight school trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year. Like many other schools preparing for this week's anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, Rich East High School in Park Forest, Ill., will have extra police officers on hand. Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds. After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction in school crime and an increase in attendance. GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track incidents of school violence and other crimes. Security will also be tightened district-wide on Monday, and teachers will discuss school safety with students. School safety has been catapulted to the top of the social agenda.",

Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.

                    "summary": " From the first contact with police officers at the hospital, and thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence were treated with insensitivity and lack of sympathy,'' the report said. A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a more active role in combating racial intolerance. The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with information about the slaying to contact police. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him. The prince expressed his \"deepest sympathy\" to Stephen's parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture in London. An official report last year condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism. Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated racism. The report, released in February, said the London police force was riddled with racism. LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales. Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk, the report said. Minorities make up more than 5 percent of the population in all of Britain, but less than 2 percent of all police officers. Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are brought under the Race Relations Act. Straw told the parliament that he had ordered an immediate inspection of the London Metropolitan police force by the Inspectorate of Constabulary. The chief of Britain's largest police force apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations between police and minorities. The action plan aims to bring the police fully within the remit of the Race Relations Act and states that all aspects of policing will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws. She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately. The report was startling in its condemnation of Scotland Yard's investigation of the murder and its conclusion that the respected police force and by implication much of British society is plagued by racism. Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence. The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and incompetently in resolving the case. Two suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder case and one other man were arrested Monday on suspicion of theft by Kent Police, police said. Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence. A spokeswoman for Kent Police told local reporters three men were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning on suspicion of theft. They were now in custody at a police station.",

About 90 percent of patients take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting stimuli. Administrators at Lake Zurich Middle School North had heard about Ritalin abuse in the community for almost three years, Principal Philip Zarob said. Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers say.",

                    "summary": " Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. The Federal Trade Commission charged a New York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders. Publicity about ADD and its cousin, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many people with the disorders more aware of their condition. By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD medication in school during the 1995-96 school year. Dennis, who has attention deficit disorder, promptly panicked. Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Dr. Brazelton is America's most respected pediatrician and a tireless advocate for children and families. Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving. Earlier this year, administrators from the school district called Albany County Child Protective Services, alleging child abuse when the Carrolls said they wanted to take Kyle off the drug. This can translate into multiple marriages, substance abuse, speeding violations and risky driving, poor job histories, difficulties in school and criminal behavior. He says ADD is misnamed because it's not an attention disorder but rather a control disorder, in which the part of the brain that organizes and plans isn't working. She has since hired a coach, Jodi Sleeper-Triplett, who, like other career coaches who specialize in attention disorders, says training can do wonders. The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need. Use of the medication increased as children aged. Dr. Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist, said the funding dedicated to looking at young children is good. Any physician can prescribe psychiatric drugs, not just psychiatrists. Researchers also found that ADHD medication was used by three times as many boys as girls and twice as many whites as blacks. The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19 ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the disorder. New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. About 90 percent of patients take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting stimuli. Administrators at Lake Zurich Middle School North had heard about Ritalin abuse in the community for almost three years, Principal Philip Zarob said. Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers say. Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US schoolchildren, scientists say.. The difficulty of identifying the disorder has been recognized for years.",

Liu Xu, an anti-virus expert, suggested computer users delete the virus with anti-virus software before December 13 or change the date. Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command Inc., said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia and the Middle East. We are entering the plague years of computer viruses. The disk from the helpline would detect and remove more than 9400 other computer viruses. The rate of computer virus infection in corporate America has nearly tripled in the past year despite a significant increase in the usage of anti-virus products. Melissa is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus, one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide since its discovery less than a week ago. The close-knit underground of computer virus creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may have been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa. Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip. HOW IT WORKS: Often arrives via e-mail, infecting computers once it is executed or run. Melissa infected hundreds of thousands of computers, but there were signs Friday that the new virus may not be spreading as quickly. Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in Microsoft Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known virus writer who calls himself VicodinES. A tip from a Swedish computer expert sent Richard Smith to a Web site run by a virus writer who identified himself with the screen name of VicodenES. When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other files on their hard drive. CERT issued a warning this week about the virus because of questions from computer users. Zamora said it is urgent that the congress comes up with an anti-cyber crime measure to shield the business community from hackers who may attempt to cripple the country's computer systems. Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows operating systems. It can also travel via diskettes and downloaded files, but electronic mail is an exquisitely more efficient carrier, given the millions of e-mail messages that traverse computer networks every day. The agency tracked down David Smith with the aid of America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider, computer network, and with old-fashioned police procedure. The virus overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable. Most are programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs. He is charged with interruption of public communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service. At Boeing, the company shut down an e-mail system that links 160,000 computers.",

                    "summary": " British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people. Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris. A British Airways Concorde travels from London to Bahrain, while Air France passengers ride the Concorde from Paris to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended. Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble. Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris. The Air France Concordes were already grounded; French aviation officials also suspended their flight certification Wednesday. British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the crash. British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday. British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747. Food critic Egon Ronay described the service on the British Airways Concorde as ''oozing luxury and refinement'' -- and, apparently, alcohol. British Airways, the only other airliner to operate the Concorde, suspended its flights on August 15. Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air France took the unsold planes in 1979. Air France had a Paris-Washington-Mexico City service from 1978 to 1991. In 1963, Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp. and Air France all signed options on the Concorde. A similar ceremony took place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served by Air France. At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France employees observed a moment of silence. British Airways and Air France both insist the aircraft was profitable, but refused to give details. Air France, which owned the crashed Concorde chartered by a German tour group setting off on a luxury cruise through the Caribbean, has not returned the jets to service since the crash. In this the Concorde resembles the Queen Elizabeth 2, which began trans-Atlantic service in the summer of 1969.",

                    "summary": " The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore, whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk after Russian efforts failed for days. The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet, Russian media reported. Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday. A look at some of the key events in the weeklong drama surrounding the sunken Russian submarine Kursk. Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons. Russian officials say they are focusing on indications that the Kursk collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine. By the time the Memphis reached Bergen, Norway, officials in Russia had said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding with either a foreign submarine or a World War II mine. As the nation and the world pray for the sailors aboard the Kursk, the relatives of the submariners are having an especially hard time. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue vessels, according to standard naval reference works. Two Norwegian ships are heading for the disaster area one the British LR5 submarine rescue craft and the other a group of Norwegian deep-sea divers. Russian rescue efforts have failed so far and Russia has accepted offers of help from Britain and Norway on Wednesday. Commander Alan Hoskins, who is organizing the British effort at the scene, said they would continue offering assistance until the Russians told them to stop. MOSCOW _ Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a diving capsule Tuesday to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a sunken Russian nuclear submarine. All previous attempts by Russian rescuers have failed. The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian navy contends. Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater distances from Russian vessels. Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine. A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight. A senior Russian naval officer said here Thursday that the 118 sailors on board the stricken Kursk submarine could survive for two more weeks before their oxygen runs out. , Russian Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov told the RTR state television.",

The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71 million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to building owners to stay in the program. The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. It would amount to the largest expansion of the housing program in a decade. With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President Clinton highlighted two new housing programs Saturday that would provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or disabled. One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he will send to Congress in February, administration officials said Tuesday. Residents of about 22 percent of the state's rental housing stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy. In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides. Position: To be public housing tenants. Lazio's measure establishes block grants to states for federal housing assistance, requires public housing tenants to perform community service and integrates those communities with economically mixed residents. The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy. Another provision would authorize money for nonprofit organizations seeking to purchase, improve and preserve affordable federally assisted and federally insured housing for the benefit of low-income tenants. The Boca Raton Housing Authority has long attracted the cream of the working poor and collects rents double that collected by other housing authorities because it has favored higher earners for years. For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year for families making as much as $40,000 a year.",

The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71 million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to building owners to stay in the program. The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. It would amount to the largest expansion of the housing program in a decade. With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President Clinton highlighted two new housing programs Saturday that would provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or disabled. One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he will send to Congress in February, administration officials said Tuesday. Residents of about 22 percent of the state's rental housing stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy. In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides. Position: To be public housing tenants. Lazio's measure establishes block grants to states for federal housing assistance, requires public housing tenants to perform community service and integrates those communities with economically mixed residents. The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy. Another provision would authorize money for nonprofit organizations seeking to purchase, improve and preserve affordable federally assisted and federally insured housing for the benefit of low-income tenants. The Boca Raton Housing Authority has long attracted the cream of the working poor and collects rents double that collected by other housing authorities because it has favored higher earners for years. For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year for families making as much as $40,000 a year. After offering his proposal in Battle Creek, Bush headed for a senior citizen center in Dearborn, pushing for elderly housing efforts. Lawmakers hope a bill approved by the House Banking Committee on Friday will counter a trend that is reducing the amount of government-subsidized housing available for the elderly and the disabled. Nearly three million households now receive housing vouchers. Nearly 3 million households now receive housing vouchers.",

                    "summary": " The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle. The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse. A spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Monday demands that the United States immediately return Cuban Boy Elian Gonzales so that he can reunite with his father. The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to issue an order to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the 6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba. The officials had said that Elian would be accompanied by Lazaro Gonzalez and Lazaro's 21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez. The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba. ELIAN _ Janet Reno clarified Elian Gonzales' legal situation by brushing aside Florida judge's interference. Wiener and the other team members met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez last weekend and briefly with Elian's Miami relatives on Monday. Father and son were reunited on April 22 after Elian was taken forcibly from the Miami relatives' home during an armed federal raid. The meeting took place at the Miami Beach home of Barry University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted a dramatic reunion between Elian and his two Cuban grandmothers in January. Miami Beach police erected metal fencing to keep the demonstrators on the far side of a divided road in front of the home, and dozens of officers patrolled the area. The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed. Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to resolve the situation. Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian should be returned to his father. Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the view of immigration officials. The march of Cuban mothers and grandmothers would be the largest single rally since the beginning of the international custody dispute began after Elian was rescued at sea in late November. Elian's custody battle began after he survived a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants on November 22, 1999. Nov. 26 -- Great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez granted temporary custody of Elian. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States.

LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to monitor the on- going transition program in the country. Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic presidential election. A 35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country. He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential election ever in Mexico. The Atlanta-based Carter Center will send 24 elections observers to the Dominican Republic to monitor May 16 elections, a spokeswoman said Thursday. it was fitting that President Clinton just happened to make a separate presentation in Atlanta to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. He remains, said Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 53 years, what he has always been _ a man constitutionally unable to sit still and do nothing. The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major political parties. Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. Hoping for a repeat of the 1996 elections, which were praised as the Caribbean country's fairest vote ever, Dominican officials have invited monitors from around the world to help observe polling. Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have observed in 10 Latin American nations. So far only former Colombian President Belisario Betancur has said he would attend, the board said. The former president of the United States was talking about the failing eyesight of a child. The two organizations are monitoring all phases of the local, state and national elections in the west African country, The Post Express reported Friday. Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections _ a major setback for the country's two traditional political parties. The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture nascent democracies. President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections.",

                    "summary": " Spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the delegation would not include former President Jimmy Carter, despite reports in local newspapers that Carter and four other former heads of state would be observers. Historian Douglas Brinkley, who is writing a three-volume biography of Carter, said the former president seems at last to be comfortable with the Jimmy Carter life story. LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to monitor the on- going transition program in the country. Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic presidential election. A 35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country. He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential election ever in Mexico. The Atlanta-based Carter Center will send 24 elections observers to the Dominican Republic to monitor May 16 elections, a spokeswoman said Thursday. it was fitting that President Clinton just happened to make a separate presentation in Atlanta to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. He remains, said Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 53 years, what he has always been _ a man constitutionally unable to sit still and do nothing. The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major political parties. Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. Hoping for a repeat of the 1996 elections, which were praised as the Caribbean country's fairest vote ever, Dominican officials have invited monitors from around the world to help observe polling. Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have observed in 10 Latin American nations. So far only former Colombian President Belisario Betancur has said he would attend, the board said. The former president of the United States was talking about the failing eyesight of a child. The two organizations are monitoring all phases of the local, state and national elections in the west African country, The Post Express reported Friday. Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections _ a major setback for the country's two traditional political parties. The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture nascent democracies. President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections. Mexico has gone through sweeping electoral reforms since its last presidential election in 1994. He urged that the constitution be amended to allow direct presidential elections in 2004. Fujimori's foes accuse his government of waging a systematic, illegal campaign of harassment to discredit and intimidate leading opposition candidates and election watchdog groups. He praised the technical aspects of Mexico's new balloting system and officials he met at the Federal Elections Institute, an independent agency supervising the elections.",
