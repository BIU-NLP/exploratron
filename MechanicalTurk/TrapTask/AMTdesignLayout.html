    <!--p>Assume you are assigned to write a <strong><i>general</i> overview</strong> on a topic given to you. This 10-sentence overview would be used to briefly explain the topic to any ordinary person whose <i>personal</i> interests are <u>not</u> known to you.</p-->
    <!--p>For the topic <strong>"${Title}"</strong>, which one of the following four sentences should <u><i>most likely</i></u> be included in the general overview?</p-->
    <p>Imagine you are required to write a <strong>short overview</strong> (8 to 10 sentences) on a topic given to you. This overview would be used as a journalistic brief that <b>explains the topic to the general audience</b>.</p>
    <p>For the topic <strong>"${Title}"</strong>, if you could select <u>only one</u> of the following 4 (true) sentences for your overview, which would it be?</p>
    
    <crowd-radio-group>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q1_1" value="${TopicId}::Q1_1::${Q1_1_answer}">${Q1_1}</crowd-radio-button>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q1_2" value="${TopicId}::Q1_2::${Q1_2_answer}">${Q1_2}</crowd-radio-button>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q1_3" value="${TopicId}::Q1_3::${Q1_3_answer}">${Q1_3}</crowd-radio-button>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q1_4" value="${TopicId}::Q1_4::${Q1_4_answer}">${Q1_4}</crowd-radio-button>
    </crowd-radio-group>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Now imagine you are given a <i>search tool</i> to assist you in learning on the topic and generating the overview. This tool first shows you a few sentences of information on the topic (which you could use in your overview).</p>
    <p>For your topic ("${Title}"), the system initially shows the following text:</p>
    <blockquote>${Q2_initial}</blockquote>
    
    <p>The system then enables you to <b>submit queries</b> to get further information on the topic. For each query, the system provides a query-focused textual snippet.</p>
    <p>After reading the initial text given by the system, from the following three possibilities below, which sequence of two queries would you submit to the system to gather the <b>next most important</b> information for your <b>overview</b>?</p>
    
    <crowd-radio-group>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q2_1" value="${TopicId}::Q2_1::${Q2_1_answer}">(1) ${Q2_1_1}; (2) ${Q2_1_2}</crowd-radio-button>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q2_2" value="${TopicId}::Q2_2::${Q2_2_answer}">(1) ${Q2_2_1}; (2) ${Q2_2_2}</crowd-radio-button>
        <crowd-radio-button name="${TopicId}::Q2_3" value="${TopicId}::Q2_3::${Q2_3_answer}">(1) ${Q2_3_1}; (2) ${Q2_3_2}</crowd-radio-button>
    </crowd-radio-group>
    
    <p>Now write a third query you would submit for your overview: <input type="text" name="third_query"></input></p>
        
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <p>Please feel free to fix the answer to the first question if you feel it should be changed in light of the information introduced in the second question.</p>
